I enjoy classes like Body Combat, Zumba, Strong by Zumba, and Turbo Kick. Most years, I run various 10k to 13k races to half marathons. I don't run full marathon as the body composition change as a person train for long races.</p><br/> <h3>Quote That Inspires You</h3> <p>I don't exactly have a quote that inspires me but I have a poem that I look to for inspiration:</p><p> <em>One night I dreamed a dream. As I was walking along the beach with my Lord. Across the dark sky flashed scenes from my life. For each scene, I noticed two sets of footprints in the sand, One belonging to me and one to my Lord.<br/><br/> After the last scene of my life flashed before me, I looked back at the footprints in the sand. I noticed that at many times along the path of my life, especially at the very lowest and saddest times, there was only one set of footprints.<br/><br/> This really troubled me, so I asked the Lord about it. "Lord, you said once I decided to follow you, You'd walk with me all the way. But I noticed that during the saddest and most troublesome times of my life, there was only one set of footprints. I don't understand why, when I needed You the most, You would leave me."<br/><br/> He whispered, "My precious child, I love you and will never leave you. Never, ever, during your trials and testings. When you saw only one set of footprints, It was then that I carried you." </em> </p><br><h3>Testing Area for Links</h3> <a href="hw1.docx">doc</a> <br/> <a href="https://frontendmasters.com/books/front-end-handbook/2018/what-is-a-FD.html">ends in HTML</a> <br/> <a href="https://img.labnol.org/files/Most-Useful-Websites.pdf">ends in PDF</a> <br/> <a href="http://www.yahoo.com">Yahoo</a> </section> <footer><hr/>class: Advance HTML and CSS with Professor Da Silva</footer> </body></html>
